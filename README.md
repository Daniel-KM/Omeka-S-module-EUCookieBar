EUCookieBar (module for Omeka S)
================================

> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better.__

[EUCookieBar] is a module for [Omeka S] that adds a European Union warning about
cookies and private life, if you use Google analytics, Facebook buttons, or your
own tools to steal personal data of your visitors.

It provides the same feature than [plugin EUCookieBar] for [Omeka Classic] and
use the [jQuery cookiebar widget] too.


Installation
------------

This module requires the library [eucookiebar], that is currently provided with
the module. It requires the library [jQuery] in the theme, generally enabled by default.

See general end user documentation for [installing a module].

* From the zip

Download the last release [EUCookieBar.zip] from the list of releases, and
uncompress it in the `modules` directory.

* From the source and for development

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `EUCookieBar`.


Quick start
-----------

Each site can enable the bar independantly. The message to display should be set
in site settings. If no message is set, the cookie bar is not enabled on the
site. Options can be set too as json. See the included library for more options.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on the [module issues] page on GitLab.
